# CAT---Cyber-Attack-Taxonomy
Cyber Attack Taxonomy, CAT
#Taxonomy development by Mildrey Carbonell Castro and supported by Francisco Luis de Andres Perez, from S21Sec, Spain.

This taxonomy was developed by the strong study of many other mature taxonomies and cyber attack analisis like the Cyber Kill Chain (Lockheed Marting), Diamond model, or the Mitre Att@ck. 
CAT is more adapted to our own Red Team attack methodologies, where the CAT model is the core of the strategy.

The attack phases are distributed trough this seven steps. The scope of some of them will be from the first one to the seven, but others just will be on lower ones.

  1. Target Profiling
  2. Compromise
  3. Infiltration
  4. Persistence
  5. Internal Recognizing
  6. Lateral Movements
  7. Target Impact Execution
